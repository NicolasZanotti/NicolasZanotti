My most recent contributions are to the [VersusVirus app](https://github.com/VersusVirus-Hackathons/VersusVirus-App) that was developed to support online hackathons fighting the effects of Coronavirus. Also, I have been [contributing to an AI](https://github.com/THEPortatCERN/Hackathon2020-Pier51) that [acts as a switchboard for real-world postcards](https://youtu.be/nA6qdSLcoeY?t=4906). I am now mainly focused on building a product that helps organize and run hackathon events â€“ online, offline, or hybrid. No public repo yet until it gets past a prototypal phase.

Between 2013 and 2019, I have been contributing to the highly successful travel startup [GetYourGuide](https://www.getyourguide.com). See the company's public repositories [here on GitHub](https://github.com/GetYourGuide).

Most of my own repositories here are of archived projects. These include a few games I have created along with a UI framework, build tools, a MediaWiki plugin, and a library for InDesign automation.
